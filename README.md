# Sussudio

ðŸŽ¶ _There's a feature that's been on my mind._
ðŸŽµ _All the time, Sus-Sussudio, oh-oh~_

Sussudio brings the internal API of VS Code to your apps. _No Compilation Required._

## Usage

Sussudio is available on NPM:

```sh
yarn add sussudio
# or
npm install sussudio
```

You can also use it in the browser via [esm.sh](https://esm.sh):

```html
<script type="module">
	import * as sussudio from "https://esm.sh/sussudio";
</script>
```

Sussudio is ES6 module, and tree-shakeable, allowing you to import only the parts you need.

## Modules

Much like VS Code, Sussudio is organized into [layers](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-wiki/blob/main/Source-Code-Organization.md).

### `sussudio/base`

```ts
import { arrays } from "sussudio/arrays";
```

> Provides general utilities and user interface building blocks that can be used in any other layer.

#### `sussudio/base/common`

- `arrays.ts` - Array utilities
- `async.ts` - Async utilities

### `sussudio/platform`

> Defines service injection support and the base services for VS Code that are shared across layers such as workbench and code. Should not include editor or workbench specific services or code.
